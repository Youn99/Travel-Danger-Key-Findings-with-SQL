# Travel Danger Key Findings with SQL.

Very often perceptions about the risk of traveling and living in certain foreign states are based on indications derived from state organs or newspapers. 
All of this often contributes to a shared public opinion, but it is not always based on actual facts. 
In this project you will rely on data released by the U.S. State Department, trying to figure out whether the states labeled as dangerous are actually the ones 
where you run the greatest risks. 

Overall, there is a significant relationship between the per capita number of U.S. deaths abroad and the number of reports a country receives. 
Mexico, Mali and Israel have been reported by most reporting agencies in recent years, but American tourists are more likely to be killed in Thailand, 
Pakistan and the Philippines.

So together my team work we had to try to get clarity and really understand which states have higher rates of risk and whether they are the same as those indicated
in the report. Finally, also try to understand which ones have lower risk rates. 

in our Script SQL we used COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION, Simply simply that's a temporary table returned by a query which is then used by another query itâ€™s temporary because the result is not stored anywhere it exists only when the query is run.
